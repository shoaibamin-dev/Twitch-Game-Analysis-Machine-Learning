PURPOSE:
To find out the best to worst group of games according to their watch-time and interest popularity (audience interest). 

FILES:
1.	twitch_analysis.ipynb (Python notebook containing the K Means clustering analysis).
2.	Twitch_game_data.csv (On which the analaysis was performed).
3.	Twitch_game_data_sample.csv

This assignment is based on the analysis of top-notch games in Twitch - A web platform where streamers (or precisely gamers) do gameplays and get donations from viewers. 

Every game consists of many channels depending on its popularity and marketing. For example, Grand Theft Auto 5 has over a thousand channels on Twitch due to its versatility and amazing missions. 

There is a dataset that contains data of over 1600 games including all the trendy games like Fortnite, Minecraft, League of Legends, and the list is long.

The games have over 3 years of data containing attributes like "Rank	Game	Month	Year	Hours_watched	Hours_Streamed	Peak_viewers	Peak_channels	Streamers	Avg_viewers	Avg_channels	Avg_viewer_ratio" 

The analysis divides the games into 5 clusters - from the best group of games to the worst group of games. Of course, the data analyst gets to decide which group is best and which is worst.

Precisely the clusters are: Best, Above Average, Average, Below Average, and Worst.

Luckily the analyses show that the best cluster verily contains the most renowned games played in this era. Long story short, the analysis went perfectly.

I will explain more about it in the presentation but I must say it was an amazing experience implementing K-means clustering and playing with the data. I have to say kudos to you for how you made us understand this topic which ultimately led us (at least me) to present a fine analysis.
